# AwesomeAstronomyWeatherWizard

Hello World. 
This is a weather app specifically for astronomers we made for our Interaction Design course at uni. # Given that it would be hard to randomly find by just googling something, you probably knew that already, though.
And now you are an expert on our project.
Thanks for reading me.
